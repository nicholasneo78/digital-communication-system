# Digital Communication System

**CE 3006: Course Project**   
*Aim: To develop a basic digital communication system using MATLAB.*

The **basic** implementation of this project consists of three phases.   
- Phase 1: Data generation 
- Phase 2: Modulation for communication  
- Phase 3: Basic error control coding to improve the performance

### Phase 1: Data generation 
This section is related to **baseband modulation and demodulation**.  
Here the binary data will be generated and will be transmitted through an additive white Gaussian noise channel with different SNR values.  
The bit error rate performance will be analysed and plotted against various SNR values. 

### Phase 2: Modulation for communication 
This section is related to **band-pass modulation and demodulation**.   
You are asked to implement **different band-pass modulation methods in the context**.   
Simple modulation methods such as **On-Off Keying and Binary Phase Shift Keying** will give a **basic start** for this.    
All are encouraged to **try out** *Binary Frequency Shift Keying and other M-ary modulation schemes*.    
*Any additional work in this direction will be rewarded with more bonus points during evaluation.*

### Phase 3: Basic error control coding to improve the performance  
The performance of the proposed communication system can be **improved further using error control codes**. It will be experimented in this phase.   
You can **use any codes available in MATLAB**, or you can **write your own channel codes** to **show the performance improvement** of the system.   

### Final note
Groups can work on this project for the **addition of more features of a communication systems** and **integrate those with the basic implementation**. All such modifications are counted for evaluation.

# Deadline
**The final project deadline is Friday of Week 12. You should submit your final report by the Friday of week 12. Your project (together with the report) will be evaluated during Week 13.**
